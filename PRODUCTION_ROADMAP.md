- **Memory Usage**: <50MB background, <100MB active
- **Battery Impact**: <2% per hour of active use
- **Storage**: <200MB for 10 language pairs

### Monetization Strategy
- **Free Tier**: 3 language pairs, basic features
- **Pro Subscription**: All languages, cloud assist, themes
- **Enterprise**: Custom models, API access, white-label

## Development Tools & Setup

### Required Development Environment
```bash
# iOS Development
- Xcode 15+
- iOS Simulator
